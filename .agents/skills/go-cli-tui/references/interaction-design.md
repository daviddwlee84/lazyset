# Interaction design

Read when shaping a screen or changing input behavior. These are defaults for
new applications; preserve established bindings when extending one.

## Layout follows the task

Start with the repeated decision and the information needed to make it. For
resource management, use a list plus detail/preview as the starting point:

```text
┌ Resources ─────────┬ Details / preview ────────────────────┐
│ > selected target │ identity, status, relevant properties │
│   another target  │                                      │
│                   │ operation result or bounded log view │
└───────────────────┴──────────────────────────────────────┘
scope · freshness · pending operation
↑↓/jk select   Tab focus   Enter inspect   / filter   ? help
```

Use an inline picker for one value, a wizard for bounded configuration, and a
monitoring dashboard for measurements. Do not copy five Git panes into a task
with only one meaningful list.

- Keep pane positions and column meanings stable. Emphasize focus and selection
  without erasing status labels.
- Put frequent actions in the footer, less frequent ones in a contextual menu,
  and explanations in help. Do not expose every shortcut at once.
- Put pending/errors beside the affected object or operation. Retain results
  somewhere accessible after a transient toast disappears.
- Distinguish loading, empty, filtered-empty, failed refresh with previous
  data, and ready. Empty results should explain a useful next action.
- Separate row actions from view actions: creation works with an empty list;
  deletion needs a current target. The help/menu uses the same eligibility.

## Navigation and input ownership

| Context | Defaults |
|---|---|
| List | `↑/↓` and `k/j`; Home/End and `gg/G` for long lists |
| Pane focus | Tab / Shift+Tab with a visible focus indicator |
| Flat list with adjacent panes/tabs | `←/→` and `h/l` move between them |
| Tree | `←/h` collapse/parent, `→/l` expand/child; Tab changes pane |
| Wide detail viewport | Left/Right and `h/l` may pan; advertise locally |
| Inspect/select | Enter; Space only for documented toggle/multiselection |
| Filter/help | `/` and `?` outside text entry |
| Back | Esc handles the nearest active interaction |
| Quit/cancel | `q` only from navigation; deliberate Ctrl+C cancellation/exit |

Do not assign `h/l` to both scrolling and pane movement in one context. Prefer
the focused widget's meaning; Tab remains the unambiguous focus path. Keep
semantic action IDs, effective keys, labels, eligibility, dispatch, and help in
one registry. Reuse keys across disjoint contexts; reject active-scope conflicts.

Route to the active overlay and its focused component first. Otherwise route to
the focused base component, then remaining applicable global bindings. Consumed
input must not fall through:

- Printable keys type in fields, including `q`, `j/k`, `h/l`, `/`, and action
  mnemonics. Do not require a Vim insert mode.
- Arrow keys edit text except the explicit live-filter behavior below. Editing
  must not unexpectedly switch panes.
- Clear multi-key sequences when context changes. For `gg`, show pending `g`,
  allow Esc cancellation, and resolve a prefix without indefinitely blocking
  other input. Use the framework's parsing rather than raw escape matching.
- Bracketed paste is text; pasted newlines must not approve or submit actions.
  Handle press/repeat/release so a physical press does not activate twice.
- Legacy terminals may equate Tab/Ctrl+I and Enter/Ctrl+M. Do not require
  these pairs to represent distinct actions.

## Search, help, and continuity

`/` enters a local live filter. Up/Down may select visible results while keeping
input focus and its cursor; `j/k` stay text. Only changed query text resets the
selection to the first result. Cursor moves and no-op edits preserve selection.

Default: **Enter accepts the query and leaves input; Enter from navigation opens
the item**. Esc while filtering clears the query and returns to navigation.
Advertise this distinction. An action palette may execute on Enter; a remote
search may require submission. Label those surfaces clearly.

Maintain query, selected stable ID, and scroll per view. Refresh follows the ID
if present; after deletion, choose the nearest remaining position and clamp the
viewport. A failed refresh is not a successful empty list. Help, details, and
wizards restore the previous valid context when closed. Manual selection takes
precedence over delayed startup suggestions.

Help starts with current-view keys, explains symbols and unavailable actions,
and reveals workflow details progressively. Add search when content warrants it.
Opening help reads existing state, without fresh network probes. Key remapping
changes the hints as well as dispatch.

## Mouse interaction

Mouse support complements keyboard access; make capture configurable so native
terminal selection remains available. Check the pinned framework's event and
mouse-mode APIs before copying examples from another major version.

- Derive rendering and hit rectangles from one pure layout calculation, including
  borders, scroll offsets, narrow-pane collapse and visible clipping. Do not
  populate hit maps as a side effect of `View`: input may precede another render.
- Click rows to select/focus. Keep activation explicit and route buttons through
  the same semantic actions and availability checks as keyboard/palette input.
- For press/release buttons, remember the semantic target on press and activate
  only when release hits that same target. Revalidate the entity, pending state
  and read-only policy on release. Cancel the press after target, overlay,
  selection or layout changes; a coordinate is not durable authority.
- Let the active modal consume all mouse events, including clicks outside its
  visible box. Closing a modal cannot activate content behind it. Wheel events
  scroll the hovered pane or active modal, respecting actual visible rows.
- In forms, clicking a field can focus it while caret editing remains keyboard
  driven. Save, Cancel and Test should preserve the same draft/review lifecycle
  as the keyboard path. Printable mouse-toggle mnemonics still type in inputs.

## Monitoring data

For a btop-like terminal dashboard, establish source semantics before choosing
charts. Use terminal-native Braille/block/ASCII renderers as appropriate, and
make narrow screens retain the actionable summary rather than a broken grid.

Keep histories bounded per target and timestamp samples at observation. Distinct
sources need distinct freshness: a working log stream does not make a failed
memory poll current. Show inactive/disconnected gaps instead of synthetic zeros.
Distinguish initial warmup zero, true zero, unavailable values and counter resets.
Label rates, cumulative counters and resource scope (process versus host).

Aggregate full snapshots before applying a browsing-row cap. If the source itself
was truncated or rejected, mark that result incomplete/stale. Drilldowns should
use stable IDs or exact structured predicates; a substring filter cannot promise
that a clicked aggregate and its detail list contain the same objects.

## Terminal presentation

- Compute sizes using terminal cells and actual style frame sizes. Clamp zero
  or negative content dimensions; resize preserves data and focus.
- Collapse secondary details or show the active pane on narrow screens. Keep
  switching and quitting available. Test 80×24, narrower, and wide layouts;
  the task determines the minimum usable size.
- Measure cells, not bytes/runes. Truncate at grapheme boundaries while keeping
  ANSI sequences intact. Wrap prose; scroll structured text. Exercise `專案`,
  `é`, and `👩🏽‍💻` in the supported terminal.
- Use semantic colors for text, focus, selection, pending, warning, error, and
  success; pair color with labels/shapes. Honor `NO_COLOR` in automatic mode;
  explicit color overrides follow the documented application policy.
- Avoid required Nerd Fonts. Make icons/motion optional; check light, dark,
  and default backgrounds. Offer a plain/linear path where full-screen layout
  is unsuitable for assistive technology.
- Sanitize external filenames/logs before display. App-generated ANSI styling
  does not authorize untrusted OSC or cursor-control sequences.
